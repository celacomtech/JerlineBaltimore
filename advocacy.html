                <b> Hiring Me as A Patient </b>
                <p>
                    I am pleased that you are exploring the option of hiring a Patient Advocate to help you or a loved one navigate today’s complex health care system. The reasons individuals or families choose to hire a patient advocate are as varied as the clients we have helped. In my experience, many loving and attentive families have enlisted my services to help a loved one out of necessity-- time, distance, job commitment, or the needs of other (often younger children) family members create a gap in care-- a gap we can fill with both experience and compassion.

                    Hiring a patient advocator is not right for every family—or every family’s situation.  I understand there is a financial investment associated with hiring outside help. I understand—I’ve been on the other side—and know that as complicated as navigating the healthcare system is, it can be equally difficult navigating the emotional consequences of your own or a loved one’s illness.

                <b>Barriers To Effective Healthcare</b>
                <p>

                    Patients have less time with doctors--average time is 8 minutes--and this challenges the doctor's ability to deliver patient-centered treatment;

                    Insurance companies are increasingly denying coverage for diagnostics, medications, treatments, hospital expenses, etc;

                    Family members cannot provide hands-on support because they often live apart from one another and/or they cannot take the time off from work;

                    People are frequently diagnosed with more than one medical condition and using several medications which makes it difficult for physicians (particularly in an emergency setting) to make fully informed decisions for patients unless they have a clear and easily accessible medical record.

                    Medical error is the third leading cause of death in the U.S. and the most common reason cited is communication problems.
