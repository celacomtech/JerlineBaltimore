                <h5>Getting Started with LCSW Supervision</h5>

                What is the purpose of Clinical Supervision?
                <p>
                    Working in the helping professions, we may feel that carrying these burdens is part of the job. The culture of helping suggests that we need to carry these burdens discreetly and to present a professional front. Clinical supervision is a space where we can explore the effects of our work, and make sense of the feelings our work evokes.

                    What to expect

                    When a Registered Intern Social Worker is under supervision, they meet with their supervisor  for 4 hours per month. All sessions are online using Zoom, so you can participate anywhere in supervision. Most people participate in a two-hour group session twice per month, which is the minimum recommended. The ultimate goal is to meet with your supervisor for 100 total hours in no less than 24 months, and it cannot take longer than 48 months to complete supervision. During this time, you must be employed and work at least 30 hours per week to be eligible to complete the supervision process in, or close to, 24 months.

                    I will try my best to offer group supervision once a month, so you can alternate and enjoy being provided feedback from other social workers who work in different areas.

                    How do I know if my job qualifies as a clinical social work position?

                    I'm often asked this question. The board has determined that if you assess, diagnose and treat mental health or substance abuse issues using DSM-V criteria for at least four hours per week, you are eligible for LCSW supervision. Do not get too concerned about making a formal diagnosis. In many settings, it is the physicians, psychiatrists or independently licensed mental health professionals who diagnose clients or patients. If you’re using a diagnostic skill set and/or screening tools when working with clients or patients, you are fulfilling this requirement.

                    I have supervised social workers employed by behavioral health hospitals and outpatient programs, medical hospitals, home health, hospice, schools, dialysis clinics, military bases, the VA, CPS, non-profits, insurance companies, EAP programs, private practices, and even police departments and prisons. As long as you have personal client or patient interactions and utilize clinical skills, you probably meet LCSW supervision criteria.

                    Getting Started

                    Once you decide to pursue LCSW supervision, we will complete a ￼social work supervision agreement and the clinical supervision plan.  My supervision is primarily in the individual setting. The hourly rate for individual sessions is $50. Expect to budget $200 per month.

                    For supervisees who occasionally want a group session, I charge $40 hourly rate and typically schedule a one hour meeting once every other Saturday at noon.

                    For more details on these guidelines, please visit the Florida Social Work Board.

                    I also suggest creating a binder or computer file for your supervision documents including keeping a ￼supervision log of the hours we complete together.



                    Below is the paperwork you’ll need to complete and email back to me. also, since your will be doing outside supervision separate from your job, please copy me on an email to your boss stating that you’ve begun LCSW supervision. I’ve included an email template with the forms.

                    Here are your next steps:

                    First, you must seek approval from the Florida State Board. You do this by sending an email to MQA.491@flhealth.gov.
