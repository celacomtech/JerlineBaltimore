Your privacy and the security of your information is extremely important to us. Jerline  is committed to safeguarding your information and maintaining the highest level of security and confidentiality of your personal and health information. Except as permitted or required by law, Jerline  will never share your personal or health related information without your explicit consent and permission. Your personal information is stored securely and will only be accessed by Jerline  personnel or business associates when it is a necessary part of their job responsibilities. All staff and business associates have been trained on the importance of confidentiality and maintaining the security of your private information.
 
Just as with traditional in-person therapy, anything you discuss with your therapist in session is kept confidential and not shared with others, unless there is a safety concern for yourself or someone else or in the case of an emergency. Your therapist will review confidentiality and the limits to confidentiality with you during your first session.
 
Any information that we collect from you (including, but not limited to, your name, contact information, information used for billing and payment purposes, other demographic data) will be used for the purposes of providing you services through Jerline  and will be kept secure and confidential. Any information or messages you exchange with your therapist and other information that is considered protected health information will also be kept secure and confidential according to all applicable laws and regulations for the protection of protected health information unless there is a safety concern for yourself or someone else, in the case of an emergency, or when explicitly requested or approved by you. 
 
The video sessions and messaging via the app are secure, encrypted end to end, and adhere to HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) guidelines for secure video and electronic communication. Video sessions are not recorded or stored. We keep all communication between clients and therapists on the Jerline  app to ensure privacy and security, and they will be securely stored for a minimum of 6 years in a manner complying with all applicable HIPAA regulations and guidelines.
 
Protecting your personal information is absolutely a priority for Jerline  and we will never disclose, release or sell your data without your explicit permission or request. We use industry best practices and adhere to HIPAA regulations and guidelines for safeguarding and protecting your information and data and preventing unauthorized access and use.
